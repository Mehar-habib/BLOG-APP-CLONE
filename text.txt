Step-by-Step Flow Explanation:
User Submission
[Login Form] → Submits credentials → [Server Action]

Initial Validation
[Server Action] → Validates with Zod → Checks if user exists

Auth.js Handoff
[Server Action] → Calls signIn("credentials") → [Auth.js Config]

Core Authentication
[Auth.js Config] → Re-validates → Compares passwords with bcrypt

Result Propagation
Success: Creates session → Redirects
Failure: [Auth.js Config] → Returns error → [Server Action] → [Error Handling]
